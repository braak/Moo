# Moo

This Repository creates a binary that prints a cow.

## Why?
This is mostly a test. It is supposed to be slightly more complex than "Hello, World!". In addition to creating a binary a library is created and linked against. In the future I plan to add more features.  

## TODO
* Unit tests
* Command-line parameters
  * '--say', '--version' and '--help'.
* GUI version, which displays an image.
